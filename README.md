# yelp-fraudulent-reviews
Analysis and model building for detecting fraudulent reviews on the Yelp Dataset.
In this repository are contained the code for the models tested. We tested both traditional statistical learning models such as an logsistic regression and naive bayes, as well as used transfer learning to build a BERT based classifier, with the transformer being already pretrained.
